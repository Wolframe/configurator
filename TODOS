tags

- delete on tree is much more dangerous than just a leaf,
  the message should be different for a tree than for a leaf
- description not so high
- dialog wider

pictures

- save picture
- sort order changes table.selected!
- after deletion: picture list is reselecting an element, but buttons
  are still disabled (missing a signal?). Same when opening the window
- suddenly a multiple selection after editing a picture also edit
  - add picture
    - main.image condition of Picture uploader
  - sizing hint of Picture Chooser for the image (is wrong)
- picture_select:
  When adding the pictures:
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailListRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailListRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)
  - in single picture select (in manufacturers):
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)

categories

- CategoryPicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)
- add CategoryFeature dialog here as subdialog where you can
  pick from the feature (and requires min/max, provides min/max)
  - show as features table in categeory add/edit (with min/max prov/req)
  => former categories_features, this is the template for all other such cases

features

- FeaturePicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)

manufacturers

components

- add ComponentFeature dialog here as subdialog where you can
  pick from feature list (and requires min/max, provides min/max)
  - show as features table in component add/edit (with min/max prov/req)

recipe

- remove button disabled, if no elements selected
- select category (1)
- select pictures (N)
- select list of features needed for the recipe (recipe_content*.ui)
- select list of components in recipe (recipe_component*.ui)
    
discussed

- resize all forms, give them nice default sizes

todo discuss

general

- not all actions in an iconized list view lead to status recalculations
  in the remove button (state:enabled)
- how things are coupled in two multiple request cases:
  'answer' should fit to 'action'
  'action:select_picture' to 'answer:select_picture'
- IMHO we should be able to set the values of a form and then overload
  them and not have to artificially split the form request in 3 parts
  (see component_edit and manufacturer_select)

compoents

- component list:
  - TBD: exact attributes in the component list
- component edit:
  - manufacturer and category are optional by db model, not in ui
  
- search for all select forms
- picture list is not restored when login in/out, of course, because they
  are temporary database tables (maybe we should remove temporary tables
  anyway!)
- shortcuts for key select everywhere, e.g. &Cancel
- dito default buttons for all forms
- property title, so we can put the name of a component into the window title
  (example add/edit xXXX)
- syntax error: code {?}; leads to completly misleading error message:
  CRITICAL: attribute not defined in answer description: "id" at ""
- not clear, where the problem is (TDL, simpleform?):
  ERROR: Error calling procedure: unknown tag  (picture)-.. candidates are {id, thumbnail, caption}
  ERROR: error in execution of REQUEST ManufacturerPictureRequest:unknown tag  (picture)-.. candidates are {id, thumbnail, caption}
- seen races between closing of window (edit category) and action
  (updateCategory)!
- QTableWidget: state contains the manually changed rulers in the header
  (for column size), not kept
- add cursor changes for long-lasting operations, e.g. transcend logo
- picture dialog:
  - idea: context menu on listwidget with pictures (with info, exclude)
- dialog semantics for edit tags: enter and esc shortcuts?
- info field in pictures?
    - must select a tag for being able to add a picture?
- ',' or ', ' in group concat?

seen and postponed or worked around

- modal in modal doesn't work:
  CRITICAL: illegal form call in modal dialog (only _CLOSE_ as next form allowed) 
  example info in picture select
  => at the moment circumvented by using normal MDI windows and the 'destroyed' datasignal
- designer plugin for Wolframe
  - plugin for request/answer: multi-line text in a first step as property 
    edit (qttests repo, experimental)
  - fails on Qt5 (completly, dynamic properties are not updated or created!)
  => currently on hold, not sure if that's the right way to go!
- feature/feature relation is for later (feature_equivalence)
