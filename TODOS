php

- request for leaves in categories/features lead to an in empty result
- return trees just up to a certain depth

tags

- delete on tree is much more dangerous than just a leaf,
  the message should be different for a tree than for a leaf
- description not so high
- dialog wider
- selecting non-leaf-nodes should implicitly select the subtree

pictures

- save picture
  - add picture
    - main.image condition of Picture uploader
  - sizing hint of Picture Chooser for the image (is wrong)
- the path of tags should be respected when searching the pictures
  
categories

- CategoryPicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)
  
features

- "used in categories" doesn't work, shows always "none"
- FeaturePicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)

feature equivalences

- add separate dialog for feature equivalences

manufacturers

- logo should be optional? a no icon button, how to set values in
  qlabel? again a dummy request?

components

- price{{main.price:0.0}}, or 0, the default value is ignored,
  the value in the widget wins:
  <price></price>
  - also: CRITICAL: element not initialized in answer: "price" at "/component" 
  - convert_to_float maybe?
- component edit:
  - manufacturer and category are optional by db model, not in ui 	!!
    - manufacturer optional makes sense
    - category not so much maybe?
  - how can we delete the manufacturer?
  - no manufacturer:
    - CRITICAL: element not initialized in answer: "id" at "/manufacturer" 
      CRITICAL: ERROR:  "-save:1067" "REQUEST error in transaction updateComponent:
      invalid input syntax for integer: "" LINE 2:   categoryID='40', manufacturerID=
- more than one description field (ca. 4 should be enough), should be able to
  contain HTML
- show inherited features, all features defined along the path of category of
  the component

recipe

- category can be option in DB model, here I thing the model is wrong and
  the client right.
      
configurations

- how to NOT open a new window? how to close a window AND open a new window?
- can't make editing of recipe mandatory (see qtclient problem with action
  used in parallel with state:enabled!)
- configurator
  - plugin: close doesn't work
  - respect modality of plugin window

general

- use stackwidgets in complex dialogs to seperate:
  - properties as price, code, name, etc
  - description and pictures
  - relations like features provided
- fix all XML request, make them look consistent
  (important for PHP layer)
  
todo discuss

unsorted

general

- resprect transactional and message character of requests and answers:
  - move picture select requests back into main select request, don't
    force the user to make two requests (think php layer!)
  - IMHO we should be able to set the values of a form and then overload
    them and not have to artificially split the form request in 3 parts
    (see component_edit and manufacturer_select)
- fix simpleforms, make them consistend (also for Php layer!)
- resize all forms, give them nice default sizes
- shortcuts for key select everywhere, e.g. &Cancel
- selection windows should keep the state (expansion, location of last
  selection), similar to a QFileDialog
- search for all select forms
- dito default buttons for all forms

manufacturer:
- not all actions in an iconized list view lead to status recalculations
  in the remove button (state:enabled)
  
components

- property title, so we can put the name of a component into the window title
  (example add/edit xXXX)
- add cursor changes for long-lasting operations, e.g. transcend logo
- picture dialog:
  - idea: context menu on listwidget with pictures (with info, exclude)
- dialog semantics for edit tags: enter and esc shortcuts?
- info field in pictures?
    - must select a tag for being able to add a picture?
- ',' or ', ' in group concat?

seen and postponed or worked around

- designer plugin for Wolframe
  - plugin for request/answer: multi-line text in a first step as property 
    edit (qttests repo, experimental)
  - fails on Qt5 (completly, dynamic properties are not updated or created!)
  => currently on hold, not sure if that's the right way to go!
- feature/feature relation is for later (feature_equivalence uis)
- picture_select:
  When adding the pictures:
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailListRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailListRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)
  - in single picture select (in manufacturers):
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)
  => quite complex to define..
- categories
  - remove button can be disabled, edit button not, why?
    => using feature_required.selected works around the problem
- picture list is not restored when login in/out, of course, because they
  are temporary database tables (maybe we should remove temporary tables
  anyway!)
