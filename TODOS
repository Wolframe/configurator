php

- test.php?what=picture&id=11 hangs ?!
- request for leaves in categories/features lead to an in empty result
 
tags

- delete on tree is much more dangerous than just a leaf,
  the message should be different for a tree than for a leaf
- description not so high
- dialog wider

pictures

- save picture
  - add picture
    - main.image condition of Picture uploader
  - sizing hint of Picture Chooser for the image (is wrong)
  
categories

- CategoryPicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)
- feature required/provided
  - can't add to an empty list:
    suppressing action "CategoryFeatureListRequest features { feature[] { id={main.required_features.row.id}; minQuantity {{main.required_features.row.min}}; maxQuantity{{main.required_features.row.max}} }; add[] { id={feature_required_select.feature.selected}; minQuantity {{feature_required_select.min}}; maxQuantity {{feature_required_select.max}} } }" because condition "main.required_features.row.id" is not met (condition not valid) 
  - remove association
    - implementation idea: send down complete list, then the unselected id set,
      build union and send back correct list
    - OPERATION results are only one row big! No clue why?!
  - edit assiciation, not implemented yet
  
features

- FeaturePicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)

manufacturers

components

- add ComponentFeature dialog here as subdialog where you can
  pick from feature list (and requires min/max, provides min/max)
  - show as features table in component add/edit (with min/max prov/req)
- order matters?! component_add
  CRITICAL: element not initialized in answer: "features_provided" at "/features_required" 

recipe

- remove button disabled, if no elements selected
- select category (1)
- select pictures (N)
- select list of features needed for the recipe (recipe_content*.ui)
- select list of components in recipe (recipe_component*.ui)
    
general

- resize all forms, give them nice default sizes
- used stackwidgets in complex dialogs to seperate:
  - properties as price, code, name, etc
  - description and pictures
  - relations like features provided
- shortcuts for key select everywhere, e.g. &Cancel

general

- selection windows should keep the state (expansion, location of last
  selection), similar to a QFileDialog
- extremly funny messages, aren't '?' values default values there
  to substitute the value, if the property doesn't exist:  
  CRITICAL: element not initialized in answer: "image" at "/picture" 
  CRITICAL: accessing non existing property "main.image.size:?" 
  CRITICAL: accessing non existing property "main.tags.item.id:?" 
  CRITICAL: accessing non existing property "main.image.size:?" 
  CRITICAL: accessing non existing property "main.image.size:?"

category: delete a tree with subtrees or leaf(s):
CRITICAL: ERROR:  "-delete_2:633" "REQUEST error in transaction deleteCategory:  Key (id)=(75) is still referenced from table "categorypicture"." 

manufacturer:
- having an image is mandatory, otherwise we get
  CRITICAL: ERROR:  "-add:928" "REQUEST error in transaction addManufacturer: invalid input syntax for integer: "" LINE 2:   VALUES ( 'bla', 'bla', 'bla', '' )
- not all actions in an iconized list view lead to status recalculations
  in the remove button (state:enabled)
- how things are coupled in two multiple request cases:
  'answer' should fit to 'action'
  'action:select_picture' to 'answer:select_picture'
- IMHO we should be able to set the values of a form and then overload
  them and not have to artificially split the form request in 3 parts
  (see component_edit and manufacturer_select)
- hard to understand for a developer to put certain dynamic properties
  to widget to avoid error messages like:
  CRITICAL: set a dynamic property of QLabel "picture_info_form.image" that is not predefined: "base64" QVariant(QString, "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD/7AARRHVja3kAAQAEAAAAPAAA/+4ADkFk...") 
- we can have multiple selection boxes for the same edit window with
  lost link behaviour, leads also to error message:
  CRITICAL: error widget visitor "QLabel" "component_edit.manufacturer" ambiguus widget link reference : "component_edit:1281_manufacturer" 
  
compoents

- component list:
  - TBD: exact attributes in the component list
- component edit:
  - manufacturer and category are optional by db model, not in ui
  
- search for all select forms
- picture list is not restored when login in/out, of course, because they
  are temporary database tables (maybe we should remove temporary tables
  anyway!)
- dito default buttons for all forms
- property title, so we can put the name of a component into the window title
  (example add/edit xXXX)
- syntax error: code {?}; leads to completly misleading error message:
  CRITICAL: attribute not defined in answer description: "id" at ""
- not clear, where the problem is (TDL, simpleform?):
  ERROR: Error calling procedure: unknown tag  (picture)-.. candidates are {id, thumbnail, caption}
  ERROR: error in execution of REQUEST ManufacturerPictureRequest:unknown tag  (picture)-.. candidates are {id, thumbnail, caption}
- seen races between closing of window (edit category) and action
  (updateCategory)!
- QTableWidget: state contains the manually changed rulers in the header
  (for column size), not kept
- add cursor changes for long-lasting operations, e.g. transcend logo
- picture dialog:
  - idea: context menu on listwidget with pictures (with info, exclude)
- dialog semantics for edit tags: enter and esc shortcuts?
- info field in pictures?
    - must select a tag for being able to add a picture?
- ',' or ', ' in group concat?

seen and postponed or worked around

- designer plugin for Wolframe
  - plugin for request/answer: multi-line text in a first step as property 
    edit (qttests repo, experimental)
  - fails on Qt5 (completly, dynamic properties are not updated or created!)
  => currently on hold, not sure if that's the right way to go!
- feature/feature relation is for later (feature_equivalence uis)
- picture_select:
  When adding the pictures:
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailListRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailListRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)
  - in single picture select (in manufacturers):
  WARNING: input form 'PictureThumbnailRequest' is not defined (document type 'PictureThumbnailRequest'). treating document as standalone (document processed with root element ignored)
  => quite complex to define..
