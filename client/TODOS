now configurator:
- Add picture and a list of pictures
- code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, should be either NULL or if not NULL unique
- on error remain on current form: fixable, handle error in network data loader,
  separate form switch and action in FormWidget
- remove fixed 50 px height hack for pictures
- configuration has categories/components
- recipe component: recipe form, add picking of componentes along to
  picking of categories (RecipeComponent table)
- configuration:
  - add components fix, mark in table the configuration as unfinished
  - dialog, present components of a category to pick from
  - categoryID gets copied from recipe.categoryID
  - every step of adding a component to a configuration gives us
    (over the categories), new features required and provided, so
    this influences whether we have to pick more or less components
    from categories full-filling the features
  - save button: if minimum requirements are satisfied

old now configurator:
- later: code as function for manufacturer + mfgCode, manufacturer
  table needs a code
- generally: no nice interface possible, current qtclient is too limited
- show thumbnails:
  - 1:n relation pictures, which picture should be shown? example:
    component 3 pictures, one is a symbol, two are a front and a back view.
    => pictures need a qualifier like (first picture)?
- open info box (modal) in feature/category/component edit and add to
  show picture information
- multi-line plain text fields (like desription in recipe) loose newlines

- stop the "whiteout", especially seen after assigning pictures
  (must be a protocol thing), happens mainly on Windows 7/8, not
  on Linux/Windows XPL:
  on FreeBSD: REQUEST, still in Data state, so the protocol misses
  the end somehow, the last m_answer contains a category tree (so
  it's a domain read), the tree stops in the middle: <tree><item id="45">,
  requests get stuffed into the queue, nothing gets ever executed,
  second time with printqstring m_answer (QString)0x7bae258 (length=0): ""
  - can be provoked by using non-debug XML sending and textwolf XML filter
    on Windows XP, so it is a failed signal for a partial line, must add
    a state like DataLeft (Data gets DataReading or so)
- ILLEGAL STATE 4 in dataAvailable!
- MDI interface
  - open forms via click on button
  - close forms on click on button
  - reload forms from other forms
  - some wiring trouble in datahandler:
    CRITICAL: ERROR: answer for unknown request of doctype "xxx": most likely the
    formwidgets share the same datahandler and the signals are missed, its list and hierarchy
    requests, so it's the domain filler.
    It happens only if the same form is picked as already shown in another window
    => happens also with only one window?!
  - resizing issues: example view picture when picture list window is quite small
- more errors
  - proper logout send a "Connection closed by server"
