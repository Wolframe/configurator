now configurator:
- configuration has categories/components
- configuration:
  - add components fix, mark in table the configuration as unfinished
  - dialog, present components of a category to pick from
  - categoryID gets copied from recipe.categoryID
  - every step of adding a component to a configuration gives us
    (over the categories), new features required and provided, so
    this influences whether we have to pick more or less components
    from categories full-filling the features
  - save button: if minimum requirements are satisfied
- Add picture and a list of pictures
- code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, should be either NULL or if not NULL unique
- on error remain on current form: fixable, handle error in network data loader,
  separate form switch and action in FormWidget

later configurator:
- respect active flags
- later: code as function for manufacturer + mfgCode, manufacturer
  table needs a code
- show thumbnails:
  - 1:n relation pictures, which picture should be shown? example:
    component 3 pictures, one is a symbol, two are a front and a back view.
    => pictures need a qualifier like (first picture)?
- open info box (modal) in feature/category/component edit and add to
  show picture information
