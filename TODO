php

- fix all XML request, make them look consistent
- request for leaves in categories/features lead to an in empty result
- return trees just up to a certain depth

tags

- delete on tree is much more dangerous than just a leaf,
  the message should be different for a tree than for a leaf
- description not so high
- dialog wider
- selecting non-leaf-nodes should implicitly select the subtree

pictures

- save picture
  - add picture
    - main.image condition of Picture uploader
  - sizing hint of Picture Chooser for the image (is wrong)

categories

- CategoryPicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)
- show inherited features, all features defined along the path of category of
  the category
  
features

- FeaturePicture with anotation caption and info (overwrite)

feature equivalences

- add separate dialog for feature equivalences

manufacturers

- logo should be optional? a no icon button, how to set values in
  qlabel? again a dummy request?

components

- how can we delete the manufacturer of a component
  (aka set it to NULL in the DB)?
- category is not optional, manufacturer is optional, how to configure
  the "save" request, so that this is checked?
- show inherited features, all features defined along the path of category of
  the component

recipe

- category is mandatory, how to check for it in the save request?
  should also be fixed in the DB model IMHO
      
configurations

- how to NOT open a new window? how to close a window AND open a new window?
- configurator form widget initial size is weird, related to the layout warnings?
- rename selectConfiguredComponentsFix

general

- use stackwidgets in complex dialogs to seperate:
  - properties as price, code, name, etc
  - description and pictures
  - relations like features provided
- short and long description or description1, description2, ... , description4
- sorting in tables doesn't work
   
todo discuss
    
general

- short and long description 
- selection forms
  - keep all states (last selected item, expanded items)
  - search for all select forms
- respect transactional and message character of requests and answers:
  - move picture select requests back into main select request, don't
    force the user to make two requests (think php layer!)
  - IMHO we should be able to set the values of a form and then overload
    them and not have to artificially split the form request in 3 parts
    (see component_edit and manufacturer_select)
- fix simpleforms, make them consistend (also for Php layer!)
- resize all forms, give them nice default sizes
- shortcuts for key select everywhere, e.g. &Cancel
- selection windows should keep the state (expansion, location of last
  selection), similar to a QFileDialog
- dito default buttons for all forms

manufacturer:

- not all actions in an iconized list view lead to status recalculations
  in the remove button (state:enabled)
  
components

- property title, so we can put the name of a component into the window title
  (example add/edit xXXX)
- add cursor changes for long-lasting operations, e.g. transcend logo
- picture dialog:
  - idea: context menu on listwidget with pictures (with info, exclude)
- dialog semantics for edit tags: enter and esc shortcuts?
- info field in pictures?
- ',' or ', ' in group concat?
- show thumbnail, first one?

seen and postponed or worked around

- designer plugin for Wolframe
  - plugin for request/answer: multi-line text in a first step as property 
    edit (qttests repo, experimental)
  - fails on Qt5 (completly, dynamic properties are not updated or created!)
  => currently on hold, not sure if that's the right way to go!
- feature/feature relation is for later (feature_equivalence uis)
- categories
  - remove button can be disabled, edit button not, why?
    => using feature_required.selected works around the problem
- picture list is not restored when login in/out, of course, because they
  are temporary database tables (maybe we should remove temporary tables
  anyway!)
- using a QLabel feature to set dynamic property selected in order not to
  have to distinguish the edit/add cases in all quantity related dialogs.
  this is a hack, but fixing needs a lot of work..
